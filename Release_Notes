MSXPi v1.0 Release Notes
========================
This release has some major changes to the hardware only:
- Replaced the EPROM 27C256 by AT28C256 EEPROM (Electronically erasable/rewritable)
- Implemented the /wait signal on the PCB (CPLD does not drives at this time, it is always tai-state)

Other non functional changes includes a new design using KiCad 5 instead of Eagle, some more jumpers to support new EEPROM features.

On the software side, only changes are the addition of new commands to rewrite the EEPROM:
- at28c256.com: will write any rom up to 32KB to the EEPROM
- at28unprot.com: Disable write protection on the EEPROM
- at28prot.com: Enable write protection on the EEPROM

As of now, to write the EEPROM, the following sequence should be performed:
1. run at28unpro
2. run at28c256
3. run at28prot

Note that you may need to specify the slot number where the MSXPi is plugged - this is a limitation of the design, that does not allow EEPROM identification for locate the slot.

All other software componentes (msxpi-server,msc-dos commands, etc) are unchanged.


MSXPi v0.8.2 Release Notes
==========================


This version contains all improvements made to all software components. There are changes to the ROM, BIOS, CALL commands, MSXPi-Client and MSX-DOS commands.
The server is officially written in Python, and the C version won't be updated anymore - support will still be available.

What can be done with MSXPi
---------------------------

The MSXPi interface is fully open source, and anyone can develop more applications.
Currently available functionalities and applications:

- Update of MSX-DOS date and time at boot time
- Config RPi wifi
- Run commands on RPi and see output on MSX screen
- Access RPi sd card: list and copy files, load .roms and .bin programs.
- Access Internet: list and copy files, load .roms and .bin programs.
- Use disk images on RPi sd card and boot from them into MSX-DOS
- Play music files on RP, control volume and music loops
- Connect to IRC and chat
- Connect to WhatsApp and chat. Client allows also to register the phone on WhatsApp (experimental, do no user your main WhatsApp phone).


List of features
----------------

- Server written in Python
- Mass transfer performed by C external program, for better performance
- Online updates to all software from a http repository
- Demonstration clients for IRC and WhatsApp, functional.
- Support for both access to SD card on RPi, and remote network files - can list, copy files, run rooms
- MSX-DOS commands to use the interface
- CALL commands to use the interface from BASIC
- BASIC client with command interpreter to use the interface
- CPLD and JTAG for logic reprogramming
- EPROM socketed to allow removal for updates using an EPROM programmer
- Two 16K EPROM banks switched by jumper (can have two different ROM versions on same EPROM)
- Compatible with all RPi models


Known Bugs
----------

Problem: Occasionally, there might happen that some commands get out of sync. This can be identified by screen being filled with dots.
Workaround: This happens more frequently when lots of reads and writes are happening, such as when running msxpiupd.bat. Try running the command again. If RPi does not recover, then reboot RPi.

Problem: Sometimes commands returns "Communication Error".
Workaround: Run PRESET and PDIR, sometimes it recovers from the problem. If it does not, restart RPi.
