Note: I have just re-designed this schematic, and sent for fabrication of test batch.
Therefore, this designed was not tested. I recommend to not fabricate this PCB until I have verified it has no errors.
I also recommend to not fabricate the older PCB (v0.7) as this one has so much improvements an features.
Best thing to do is wait until I remove this Warning!
